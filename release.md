3 New things!

### Tip Jar

If you have added your Venmo username in the back-end, a "Tip Jar" will be added to the navigation.

### Facebook Sharing

Facebook Open Graph sharing meta-data is now being pulled from the back end. Manage the content with the Site / Thumbnail Photo and Band / Description (Short Bio)

### Quick Link to Back End

There should be a "gear" in the top left that is a link to the back end. Is it too subtle or not enough? Not sure and looking for feedback.
